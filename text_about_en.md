# Our Mission

The Central African Forest Plot Network (cafriPlot) aims to improve our understanding of the structure, composition, and dynamics of Central African forests through long-term monitoring of permanent forest sample plots.

By collecting consistent, high-quality data across diverse forest ecosystems, we provide crucial insights for conservation, sustainable forest management, and climate change mitigation strategies.

# History
Established in 2010, cafriPlot began as a collaboration between research institutions in Cameroon and France. Today, cafriPlot represents one of the most extensive networks of permanent forest sampling plots in Africa, contributing valuable data to global forest monitoring initiatives.

# Strengths

Three strengths of the network we want to highlight:

1. Excellent georeferencing of plot border that allow precise congruency with remote sensing products.
2. Regular taxonomic updates thanks to more than 3000 herbarium collections linked to plot individual. Those herbarium collections are stored in BRLU (Herbarium and Library of African Botany, Brussels Belgium).
3. Samples of soil documenting physical and chemical edaphic properties for many plot.

# Our Approach

- Establish and maintain permanent forest plots using standardized methodologies
- Regularly census trees to track growth, mortality, and recruitment
- Document species diversity and forest composition
- Measure carbon stocks and monitor changes over time
- Foster collaboration between local and international researchers
- Share data and findings with the scientific community and policymakers

# Research Focus

Our research focuses on several key areas:

## Forest Dynamics
Understanding how forests change over time in response to climate and other factors

## Biodiversity
Documenting plant diversity and distribution patterns across Central Africa

## Carbon Cycling
Quantifying carbon storage and sequestration in forest ecosystems

## Climate Change
Assessing forest resilience and responses to changing climate conditions
